MEASURE OF ENERGY CONSUMPTION
INTRODUCTION:	
            Today electrical energy is the basic need of human beings .It is the prime mover of the many of the electrical components. The future is based on the electricity so we need to save it, because they will not available for long days. “ENERGY CONSUMPTION INDICATOR” mainly aims at households to bring their electricity bill down with the help of the energy consumption alert system and also alert for power factor, as well as frequency. Energy meters being deployed at homes and industries are used for reading the power, i.e. energy being consumed.
 APPLICATION:
➡ Economic Savings: Monitoring energy consumption in households allows us to identify which appliances and devices consume the most energy in our homes. By knowing this information, we can use them more efficiently and reduce our electricity consumption, which translates into long-term economic savings. Additionally, we can identify possible energy leaks and solve them in time, avoiding unnecessary expenses on the electricity bill.
➡ Reduction of Carbon Footprint: Energy consumption is one of the main emitters of greenhouse gases, which are the main culprits of climate change. By reducing our electricity consumption, we are reducing our carbon footprint and contributing to the fight against climate change.
➡More Responsible Use of Natural Resources: Electricity is generated from natural resources such as oil, natural gas, and coal. These resources are limited, and their extraction and processing have a negative impact on the environment. By monitoring and reducing our electricity consumption, we are making the resources safe.


 

PROJECT OVERVIEW:
        Of the total consumption for 2022, 44% was used in transport, 29% in industry (including non-energy uses), and 20% in the residential, services, and agriculture sector. The remainder is consumed in power plants (1%) and in the hydrocarbon industry (6%)..

CODING:
import  psutil
def measure_energy_consumption():
     energy_before = psutil.sensors_battery().percent
    # Perform the task or operation for which you want to measure energy  consumption
    # ...
    # ...
    energy_after = psutil.sensors_battery().percent
    energy_consumed = energy_before - energy_after
    return energy_consumed

# Example usage

DISADVANTAGES:
        The environmental problems directly related to energy production and consumption       include air pollution, climate change, water pollution, thermal pollution, and solid waste disposal. The emission of air pollutants from fossil fuel combustion is the major cause of urban air pollution.

MEASURE OF ENERGY CONSUMPTION

DESIGN THINKING:
1. Empathize:
• Understand the users and stakeholders: Identify the people and organizations affected
by energy consumption, such as homeowners, businesses, and communities.
• Conduct user research: Interview, survey, or observe users to gain insights into their
energy usage behaviors and pain points.

2. Define:
• Define the problem: Based on your research, create a problem statement that clearly
outlines the energy consumption issue and its impact.
• Identify opportunities: Look for areas where energy consumption can be optimized,
reduced, or made more efficient.

3. Ideate:
• Brainstorm solutions: Gather a diverse group of people to generate a wide range of
ideas for addressing the defined problem. Encourage creativity and open-mindedness.
• Use techniques like mind mapping, brainstorming sessions, or design workshops to
generate innovative solutions.

4. Prototype:
• Develop concepts: Create rough prototypes or mock-ups of potential solutions. These
can be physical or digital representations of your ideas.
• Test and refine: Gather feedback from users and stakeholders and make iterative
improvements to your prototypes. This helps to validate the feasibility and effectiveness
of your ideas.

5. Test:
• Implement a pilot project: Choose one or more of the most promising solutions and
implement them on a small scale to test their viability and impact.
• Collect data: Monitor energy consumption before and after implementing the solution,
and gather feedback from users to assess its effectiveness.

6. Implement:
• Scale up successful solutions: If the pilot project proves successful, expand its
implementation to a larger audience or area.
• Collaborate with relevant stakeholders, such as local governments, utility companies,
and environmental organizations, to support and fund large-scale adoption.

7. Evaluate:
• Continuously assess and analyze the impact of the implemented solutions.
• Adjust and refine the solutions as needed to optimize energy consumption further.

8.Iterate:
• Use the feedback and data gathered to inform further improvements and refinements.
Continue to seek new opportunities for reducing energy consumption and enhancing
sustainability.

Throughout this design thinking process, it's important to involve a multidisciplinary team that
includes experts in energy, technology, design, and user experience. Also, consider the social,
economic, and environmental aspects of energy consumption to ensure that the solutions are
sustainable and address the needs and values of the users and society as a whole.

INNOVATIVE IDEAS ABOUT ENERGY CONSUMPTION:
Innovative ideas about energy consumption can have a significant impact
on reducing our carbon footprint and promoting sustainability. Here are some creative and
forward-thinking ideas to consider:
1. Energy-Generating Pavements: Develop roads and walkways with kinetic energy-capturing
surfaces. As people and vehicles move over these surfaces, they generate electricity, which can
be used to power streetlights, nearby buildings, or charge electric vehicles.
2. Solar-Powered Roads: Create roads and highways with integrated solar panels. These solar
roadways can capture solar energy and convert it into electricity, which can power nearby
infrastructure or be fed back into the grid.

3. Energy-Positive Buildings: Design buildings that generate more energy than they consume. This
can be achieved through a combination of solar panels, wind turbines, geothermal systems, and
energy-efficient design.
4. Smart Grids and Demand Response: Implement smart grids that use advanced sensors and
data analytics to optimize energy distribution. Enable demand response systems that
encourage consumers to use electricity during off-peak hours when it's more sustainable and
cost-effective.
5. Energy-Producing Green Spaces: Create urban green spaces with energy-generating features.
For example, parks with wind turbines or kinetic energy-producing exercise equipment that
feeds electricity into the grid.
6. Piezoelectric Flooring: Install piezoelectric floor tiles in high-traffic areas such as malls, airports,
and train stations. When people walk on these tiles, they generate electricity, which can be
used to power nearby lighting and small devices.
7. Thermal Energy Storage: Develop systems that store excess thermal energy generated during
the day (e.g., from solar panels) and release it at night for heating and cooling, reducing the
need for traditional HVAC systems.
8. Energy-Efficient Micro grids: Establish micro grids that are highly efficient and resilient, serving
specific communities or industrial areas. These micro grids can integrate renewable energy
sources and energy storage solutions.
9. Block chain for Energy: Implement block chain technology to enable peer-to-peer energy
trading. This allows individuals and businesses to buy and sell excess energy directly to one
another, reducing energy waste and costs.
10. Energy-Positive Transportation: Promote electric vehicles (EVs) that not only use clean energy
but also give back energy to the grid when parked, acting as mobile energy storage units.
11. Community Energy Sharing: Encourage communities to create local energy-sharing programs.
Excess energy generated by one household can be shared with neighbors who need it,
promoting a sense of energy interdependence.
12. Energy-Efficient Data Centers: Develop highly energy-efficient data centers that use renewable
energy sources, waste heat recovery, and advanced cooling techniques to minimize energy
consumption.
13. Energy-Efficient Appliances: Continue to innovate and improve the energy efficiency of
everyday appliances and devices, reducing phantom power and waste.
14. Ocean and Tidal Energy: Invest in technologies that harness energy from ocean currents and
tides, offering a consistent and reliable source of renewable energy.
15. Advanced Energy Storage: Develop next-generation energy storage solutions like advanced
batteries, compressed air energy storage, and super capacitors to make better use of
renewable energy.
Innovative ideas about energy consumption often require collaboration between
governments, industries, and research institutions. They have the potential to reshape how we
generate, use, and think about energy in a more sustainable and eco-friendly manner.
